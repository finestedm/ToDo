This is my attemp at creating ToDo app according to TheOdinProject requirements. 
It is build using OOP (Projects & Tasks) with vanilla JS, HTML & CSS. 
Working with Webpack in separate modules.
App in version  1.0 allows for creating new Projects, adding tasks with different description, priority and due date. 2 basic lists allow for viewing of high priority tasks and next week tasks from all projects.
